Introduction
The Dynamic RESTful API is built using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM. It allows you to manage your database operations efficiently with minimal configuration. The dynamic nature of this API means you can quickly add new models and corresponding endpoints without having to write redundant code.

Features
  - Dynamic CRUD Operations: Automatically handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for defined models.
  - Express Framework: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  - Sequelize ORM: Powerful ORM for Node.js that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL.
  - Configurable Models: Easily add or modify models to extend the API.
  - Scalable Architecture: The architecture is designed to support a growing number of models and routes.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
  Node.js: v14.x or later
  npm: v6.x or later
  MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite/MSSQL: Any of these databases can be used with Sequelize.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/ArrowTech0515/Dynamic-Restful-API-using-Express-and-Sequelize.git
  cd Dynamic-Restful-API-using-Express-and-Sequelize

2. Install the required dependencies:
  npm install

3. Configure your database connection:
  - Copy the .env.example file to .env:
    cp .env.example .env
  - Update the .env file with your database credentials.

4. Run the initial migrations:
  npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

5. Seed the database (if applicable):
  npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

Usage
  Start the application using the following command:
    npm start

  The API will be running on http://localhost:3000 by default (or the port specified in your .env file).

Project Structure
  The project follows a structured and organized architecture:
  
  ├── config/            # Database configuration files
  ├── controllers/       # Controllers for handling API logic
  ├── models/            # Sequelize models for database tables
  ├── routes/            # Express routes for each model
  ├── services/          # Business logic and reusable service functions
  ├── middlewares/       # Custom middleware (e.g., authentication, logging)
  ├── utils/             # Utility functions and helpers
  ├── migrations/        # Sequelize migration files
  ├── seeders/           # Seeder files for populating the database
  └── app.js             # Main application entry point

API Endpoints
  The API dynamically generates endpoints for each defined model. Here's an example of what typical endpoints might look like:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
  GET	/api/v1/users	Retrieve all users
  GET	/api/v1/users/:id	Retrieve a user by ID
  POST	/api/v1/users	Create a new user
  PUT	/api/v1/users/:id	Update a user by ID
  DELETE	/api/v1/users/:id	Delete a user by ID
You can add new models to the models/ directory, and the corresponding endpoints will be automatically generated.
